# Call for Ambassadors SciPyLA

The SciPy Latin America community consists of a diverse and distributed
group of professionals and amateurs of scientific research with the common
goal in mind of fostering the adoption of state-of-the-art tools powered
by the Python programming language.
[SciPyLA Ambassadors](https://github.com/scipy-latinamerica/organizers/blob/master/contacts/ambassadors.md)
role was created in 2016
in order to cope with the organization of SciPyLA 2016 conference and with the
natural outgrowth of the community throughout the Latin American region
beyond the frontiers of the founding members' home country, Argentina,
and the conference host, Brazil.

Looking forward to the SciPyLA 2017 conference the OrgaTeam is releasing the
[Call for SciPyLA Ambassadors form]() so that all the
parties interested in leading the Latin America scientific community
be able to apply. The goals are the following:

- Ensure that all the countries of the Latin American subcontinent
  be represented in the SciPyLA 2017 conference next year
- Execute the budget assigned to each country to organize related activities
  prior to SciPyLA 2017
- Find and coordinate sponsorship opportunities involving
  corporations, startups and small business operating in Latin America
- Expand the SciPyLA network of contacts and sponsors
  throughout the region
- Expand the SciPyLA network of contacts and sponsors
  in North America and Europe
- Create efficient communication channels to reach the
  Latin American Python and scientific communities as well as
  non-profits, universities, research facilities, governmental
  institutions, corporations, small businesses and all other
  stakeholders interested in supporting the efforts of
  providing outreach and education to foster the adoption of
  open source research tools
- Identify and propose referees for the academic program
  as well as provide them with assistance.
- Create the foundations to manage in-situ the financial aid packages
  (e.g. flight tickets, hotel reservation, ...) requested by
  prospective attendees
- Contribute to the press strategy of the OrgaTeam by recording videos,
  and interviews about the projects and activities happening in the
  different Latin American countries and related to the
  use of the Python programming language in scientific research.
- Let Ambassadors speak to the OrgaTeam on behalf of their countrymen
  during the SciPyLA 2017 conference, and assist in the efforts to
  create a comfortable and inclusive environment encouraging
  their participation
- Ensure the continuity of the events by redacting and gathering
  proposals to organize the SciPyLA 2018 event.

The OrgaTeam will work together with Ambassadors so as to provide them
with support to execute scheduled tasks, to ensure they will be credited
for all their contributions, to prioritize their requests for financial
support, and to ensure that they will receive all the benefits for the
concept of collaborations and bonuses.
