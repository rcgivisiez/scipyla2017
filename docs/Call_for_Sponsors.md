### Additional remarks 

If interested in distributing stickers, brochure, T-shirts or other assets printed
on paper as well as T-shirts of the conference with your company, project or
product logo then it is possible to pay for local printing services. Printing
fees are not included in the price associated with a package.
Our local partners will ensure matching your quality standards and will offer
special discounts depending on the number of items in question and whether
they will be offered for sale or not. Specific instructions will be published
few months before the conference starts.
